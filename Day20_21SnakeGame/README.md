# Snake Game

## Overview
This project is a simple yet entertaining Snake Game built with Python. Utilizing the `turtle` module for graphics and `pydub` for sound effects, it offers a classic gaming experience with a modern twist. The game includes features like a moving snake, randomly appearing food, and a scoreboard to track your score.

## Files in the Project
- `main.py`: The main script to run the game. It sets up the game window, initializes game components, and includes game loop logic.
- `snake.py`: Defines the `Snake` class for handling the snake's movement and appearance.
- `food.py`: Contains the `Food` class, which randomly places food on the screen.
- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the game's scoring system, showing the current score and high score.

## How to Set Up
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install `pydub` for sound effect functionality using `pip install pydub`.
3. Clone this repository or download the files to your local machine.
4. Run `main.py` to start the game.

## Playing the Game
- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
- Try to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen.
- Each piece of food eaten increases your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's body.
