# Pomodoro Timer Application

## Overview
This Pomodoro Timer Application is a Python-based tool designed to boost productivity using the Pomodoro technique. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) created with `tkinter`, allowing users to manage work and break intervals effectively. The application alternates between work periods and short or long breaks, helping to maintain focus and rest.

## Files in the Project
- `main.py`: The main script of the application, including the timer logic and GUI setup.

## How to Set Up
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with the `tkinter` module (usually included in standard Python installations).
2. Download the `main.py` file.
3. Run `main.py` to launch the Pomodoro Timer.

## Using the Application
