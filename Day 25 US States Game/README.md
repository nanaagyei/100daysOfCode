# U.S. States Game

## Overview
The U.S. States Game is an interactive Python application designed to test and enhance geographical knowledge of the United States. Using the `turtle` and `pandas` modules, the game displays a blank map of the U.S., prompting users to enter state names. When a correct state name is entered, it appears on its corresponding location on the map.

## Files in the Project
- `main.py`: The main script for the game. It handles user inputs, map display, and state name placement.
- `50_states.csv`: A CSV file containing the names and coordinates of all U.S. states (please ensure this file is in the same directory as `main.py`).

## How to Set Up
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with the `turtle` and `pandas` modules.
2. Download the project files, including the `50_states.csv` file.
3. Run `main.py` to start the game.

## Playing the Game
