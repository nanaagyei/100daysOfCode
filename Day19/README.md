# Turtle Race Game

Welcome to the Turtle Race Game! In this game, you will bet on a turtle to win the race. Each turtle has its own color, and you can choose which one you think will be the winner.

## How to Play

The game window will appear with six turtles lined up at the starting position.

You will be prompted to enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on. Type the color (e.g., "red", "blue", "green") and press Enter.

The turtles will start racing when you press Enter after making your bet.

The turtles will move forward random distances at each step.

The race will end when one of the turtles reaches the finish line, which is at the right edge of the window (x-coordinate = 230).

If your bet matches the color of the winning turtle, you win! Otherwise, you lose.

The game will display a message indicating whether you won or lost the bet.

## Available Colors

The turtles have the following colors: "red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", and "purple".

## Note

Each time you run the game, the turtles' starting positions and random movements will be different, making the race unique each time.
