# Turtle Crossing Game

## Overview
This Turtle Crossing Game is an interactive Python project where the player controls a turtle character to safely cross a busy road. The game becomes progressively challenging as the player advances through levels. It's built using the Python `turtle` module, featuring dynamic car generation and level progression.

## Files in the Project
- `main.py`: The main game script. It initializes the game environment, player, car manager, and scoreboard.
- `player.py`: Defines the `Player` class for controlling the turtle character's movements.
- `car_manager.py`: Contains the `CarManager` class, responsible for creating and managing cars that move across the screen.
- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the game's level display and updates it as the player progresses.

## How to Set Up
1. Ensure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Download the project files to your local system.
3. Run `main.py` to start the game.

## Playing the Game
- The objective is to guide the turtle to the other side of the road without colliding with cars.
- Control the turtle using the 'Up' arrow key.
- Successfully reaching the other side increases the level and the speed of cars.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (standard library)
