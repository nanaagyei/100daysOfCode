# Coffee Machine Program

This is a simple coffee machine program written in Python. 
The program simulates a coffee machine that allows users to choose from different coffee options, process payments, and dispense the selected coffee if the required resources are available.

## Features

The coffee machine offers three coffee options:
Espresso
Latte
Cappuccino
Each coffee option has specific ingredients and a cost associated with it.
Users can check the available resources by typing "report".
Users can turn off the coffee machine by typing "off".

## How to Use

Run the Python script, and the coffee machine will start.
Type the name of the coffee you want (e.g., "espresso", "latte", or "cappuccino").
Follow the instructions to insert coins when prompted, specifying the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies you are paying with.
If the coffee machine has enough resources and the payment is successful, it will display the change (if any) and serve the coffee.
If the machine doesn't have enough resources or the payment is insufficient, it will inform you accordingly.
You can check the available resources and the profit by typing "report".
To turn off the coffee machine, type "off".

## Resources

The coffee machine has the following initial resources:

Water: 300ml
Milk: 200ml
Coffee: 100g
Profit

The initial profit is set to $0. The program will update the profit whenever a successful transaction is made for a coffee.

## Note

This is a simplified version of a coffee machine, and it doesn't have a storage mechanism for money or permanent data storage. When you turn off the machine, the resources and profit will reset to their initial values.
