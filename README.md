# 100 Days of Python Code
Welcome to my 100 Days of Python Code repository! 
In this repository, you will find a collection of simple Python projects I have created over 100 days. 
I will commit to a new project each day, demonstrating my progress and growth as a Python programmer.

For days 1 to 15, I revised basic Python syntax, data types, conditionals, classes, and functions. I started putting them into practice from day 16. Here are the projects I created from that time. 
Hope you enjoy it!
