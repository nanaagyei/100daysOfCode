# Habit Tracking Application

## Overview
The Habit Tracking Application is a Python-based tool designed to help users track their daily habits or activities. It interacts with Pixela, a service that visualizes habit tracking as pixels in a graph. The application allows users to create and manage their habit-tracking graphs through the Pixela API.

## Files in the Project
- `main.py`: The main script for interacting with the Pixela API to create user profiles, graphs, and track habits.

## How to Set Up
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system, along with the `requests` module.
2. Sign up for an account on Pixela and obtain a user token.
3. Download the `main.py` file.
4. Update the `USERNAME`, `USER_TOKEN`, and `GRAPH_ID` variables in `main.py` with your Pixela credentials and desired graph ID.
5. Run `main.py` to start creating and managing your habit-tracking graphs.

## Using the Application
- The script allows for creating a new user profile on Pixela.
- Users can create graphs for different habits or activities they want to track.
- Daily progress can be logged as pixels in the graph, providing a visual representation of habit adherence.
- Customize the script to add, update, or delete pixels based on your tracking needs.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `requests` module for API interactions

## Credits
This application is ideal for anyone looking to visualize and maintain consistency in their daily habits or activities.
