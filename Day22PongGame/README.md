# Pong Game

## Overview
This Pong Game project is a modern implementation of the classic arcade game using Python. It features a simple two-player game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The game uses the `turtle` module for the graphical interface and is designed to be both fun and easy to play.

## Files in the Project
- `pong_game.py`: The main script to start and run the game. It initializes the game screen, paddles, ball, and scoreboard.
- `paddle.py`: Defines the `Paddle` class to control the paddle's appearance and movements.
- `ball.py`: Contains the `Ball` class, which manages the ball's movement and behavior when it collides with walls or paddles.
- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the scoring system, displaying the scores for each player.

## How to Set Up
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download the project files to your local machine.
3. Run `pong_game.py` to start the game.

## Playing the Game
- The game is played by two players.
- Each player controls a paddle (left and right) using the keyboard.
- Left paddle: Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to move up and down.
- Right paddle: Use the 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys for movement.
- The goal is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle to score points.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (standard library)
